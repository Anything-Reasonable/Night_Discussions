1. Include the iostream header file in our code to use its function.
2. Include the vector header file in our code to use its functions.
3. Include the std namespace in our code to use its classes without calling it.
4. Call the main() function. The program logic should be added within the body of this function.
5. Create a vector named vector1 to store integers.
6. Use a for loop to create variable x with values from 1 to 10.
7. Push the values of variable x into the vector.
8. Print the size of the vector alongside other text on the console.
9. Print the capacity of the vector alongside other text on the console.
10. Print the maximum number of items the vector can hold alongside other text on the console.
11. Resize the vector to hold only 5 elements.
12. Print the new size of the vector alongside other text.
13. Check whether the vector is not empty.
14. Print text on the console if the vector is not empty.
15. Use an else statement to state what to do if the vector is empty.
16. Text to print on the console if the vector is empty.
17. The program must return value upon successful completion.
18. End of the main() function body.
