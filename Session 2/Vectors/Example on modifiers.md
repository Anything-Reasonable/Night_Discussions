1. Include the iostream header file in our code to use its functions.
2. Include the vector header file in our code to use its functions.
3. Include the std namespace to use its classes without calling it.
4. Call the main() function. The program logic should be added inside its body.
5. The start of the body of the main() function.
6. Declare a vector named nums to store some integer values.
7. Store 5 elements in the vector nums. Each with a value of 1.
8. Print some text on the console
9. Use an iterator variable a to iterate over the elements of vector nums.
10. Print the values of vector nums on the console for each iteration.
11. Add the value 2 to the end of the vector nums.
12. Declare an integer variable n to store the size of the vector nums.
13. Print the last value of vector nums alongside other text. It should return a 2.
14. Remove the last element from the vector nums. The 2 will be removed.
15. Print text on the console. The \n moves the cursor to the new line to print the text there.
16. Use an iterator variable a to iterate over the elements of vector nums.
17. Print the values of vector nums on the console for each iteration.
18. Insert the value 7 to the beginning of the vector nums.
19. Print the first value of vector nums alongside other text. It should return 7.
20. Delete all elements from the vector nums.
21. Print the size of the vector num alongside other text after clearing all contents. It should return 0.
22. End of the body of the main() function.
