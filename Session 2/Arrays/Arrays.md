# C++ Array
C++ provides a data structure, the array, which stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

## How to use?

1. Declaring Arrays
`type arrayName [ arraySize ]`  

2. Initializing Arrays
`double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 17.0, 50.0}`
`balance[4] = 50.0`

3. Accessing Array Elements
`double salary = balance[9]`
