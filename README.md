# Night_Discussions

Add Material from Discussions being conductd bi-weekly.

### Few Guidelines
* Create a seperate branch for a defined topic or use a related existing one.
* Add or update the directory with topic or code. 
* Do not spam or add useless commits.
* Use master branch for instructions only.
* Seperate branches can be - DS (add stack, queue, linkedlist, graps), Algos, Good-Coding-Practices (add OOPSs, Modularisation of Codes, and others stuff).
